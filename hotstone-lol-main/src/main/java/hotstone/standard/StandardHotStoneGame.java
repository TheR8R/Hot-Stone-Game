/** This is the 'temporary test stub' in TDD
 * terms: the initial empty but compilable implementation
 * of the game interface.
 *
 * It already includes a bit of FAKE-IT code for the first
 * test case about hand management.
 *
 * Start solving the AlphaStone exercise by
 * following the TDD rythm: pick a one-step-test
 * from your test list, quickly add a test,
 * run it to see it fail, and then modify this
 * implementing class (and supporting classes)
 * to make your test case run. Refactor and repeat.
 *
 * While this is the implementation of Game for
 * the AlphaStone game, you will constantly
 * refactor it over the course of the exercises
 * to become the 'core implementation' which will
 * enable a lot of game variants. This is also
 * why it is not called 'AlphaGame'.
